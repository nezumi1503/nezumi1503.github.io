excerpt: 'In this paper we demonstrate how to pick a narrow band of velocities from a beam of hydrogen atoms. This is important for performing studies on a chemical reactivity between the atoms and ions trapped in a cryogenic ion trap - another device that is being developed by me. We performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations in order to determine a proper design and carried out confirmatory experiments. As a result, we have shown that 52% of particles with <i>v</i> within Â± 10 m/s of the target velocity are transmitted for <i>v</i> = 200 m/s, for example. I have built a mathematical model that helped us to interpret results of computer simulations. Without that, we would have struggled to explain some of the observed phenomena.'
