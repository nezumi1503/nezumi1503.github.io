collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-patent
excerpt: "The supply circuit system of a planar Paul trap, where on the substrate (1) there are at least two electrode segments (2) arranged in the closed planar shape and a ground electrode (11) located in the middle of the shape, whereas the electrode segments (2) are electrically interconnected. Further on the substrate (1) there are waveguides (3) arranged in such way that to the input waveguide (31) at least one symmetrizing element is connected directly or via the input branch (32), preferably Marchand balun (33), and at least two resonance branches are further connected to each symmetrizing element and each resonance branch is connected directly or via at least one connecting branch (36) to at least one electrode segment (2), and the ground electrode (11) is grounded. The electrode segments (2) and the ground electrode (11) are preferably located on one side of the substrate (1) and the waveguides (3) are located on the opposite side of the substrate (1)."
