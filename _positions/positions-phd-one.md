# Exciting PhD Opportunity in Cutting-Edge Quantum Research! ðŸŒŸ

Are you ready to embark on a journey at the forefront of applied and fundamental sciences? We're thrilled to announce a unique PhD position that delves into the unexplored territory of quantum systems. Join our dynamic team as we push the boundaries of knowledge and work towards developing a groundbreaking radio-frequency signal detection scheme.

## Project Description
In this high-risk-high-gain project, we aim to revolutionize signal detection by utilizing free electrons as detectors and laser-cooled ions for information read-out. Within a quantum mechanically coupled system housed in a special ion trap, we will create a highly efficient and tuneable detector capable of detecting single photons of electromagnetic radiation. This device, initiating itself without special state preparation steps, is not only robust but also remarkably simple. Information read-out will be accomplished through a fiber-based optical cavity. Looking ahead, we aspire to explore how the coupling of electron and ion quantum systems can unlock additional signal information, including phase and propagation direction.

## Project Objectives
- Develop an efficient and tuneable radio-frequency signal detector using trapped electrons and laser-cooled ions.
- Deepen our quantum-mechanical understanding of the coupled system to uncover avenues for obtaining additional signal information.

## Requirements
We are seeking enthusiastic candidates with the following qualifications:
- Skills in using lasers, CAD, and programming.
- A master's degree in quantum optics, quantum chemistry, or plasma physics.

Join our collaborative team, where young theoreticians and experimentalists synergize to significantly advance our understanding of this unparalleled quantum system. This is your chance to contribute to groundbreaking research that has never been realized before.

## How to Apply
If you're ready to be part of this pioneering project, send your CV, cover letter, and academic transcripts to [Michal](mailto:michal.hejduk@matfyz.cuni.cz). Be prepared to embark on an extraordinary journey of discovery and innovation.
