I am an enginner with the experience from an academic sphere. During my two post-doc appointments and PhD studies, I did research in fields of plasmochemistry, cluster physics and ultra-cold chemistry. 

I constructed a device that confines a cloud of ions at such low temperatures (less than -273 degrees Celsius) that it “freezes” and forms a “gas-phase” crystal. This will be eventually attached to a source of neutral atoms and molecules that move at a snail’s speed, typical for a gas cooled down to less than -260 degrees Celsius. By letting the ions and the neutrals collide in this way, the scientists will once be able to study quantum-mechanical rules that chemical reactions obey.

Techniques employed: FEM, CAD, Zemax, Python, C++.


About me
======
Currently, I am working as an optical engineer in the automitive industry.

In years 2017--2020, I was a [post-doctoral research associate](http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/dr-michal-hejduk.aspx) in the [Heazlewood Group](http://heazlewood.chem.ox.ac.uk/) at the Departmenf of Chemistry of the University of Oxford (UK).

Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the [Institute of Physics](https://www.physik.uni-freiburg.de/) of the University of Freiburg (Germany). I gained my doctoral degree at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.mff.cuni.cz) of Charles University (Czech Republic).
