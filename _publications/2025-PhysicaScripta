excerpt: "We demonstrate the ultra-high vacuum compatibility of a microwave-driven electron trap and an atomic oven (for atomic beam generation) fabricated through 3D printing via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The trap integrates into a coaxial microwave cavity, enabling stable, narrow-band, high-amplitude oscillations of the electric field at the electrodes. The design also supports simultaneous trapping of ions. The oven performs well in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments without significant outgassing. In addition to achieving the UHV regime for 3D-printed components, pressure variations and their potential impact on electron-ion trapping experiments were investigated over a month. Our results show that experiments with electrons photodetached from trapped and laser-cooled ions are feasible with the trap and oven manufactured by the L-PBF method. These findings establish a foundation for future experiments in microwave detection and the study of low-energy ion-electron interactions at room temperature."
