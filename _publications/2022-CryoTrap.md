excerpt: "Ultra-high vacuum conditions are ideal for the study of trapped ions. They offer an almost perturbation-free environment, where ions confined in traps can be studied for extended periods of time—facilitating precision measurements and allowing infrequent events to be observed. However, if one wishes to study processes involving molecular ions, it is important to consider the effect of blackbody radiation (BBR). The vast majority of molecular ions interact with BBR. At 300 K, state selection in trapped molecular ions can be rapidly lost (in a matter of seconds). To address this issue, and to maintain state selectivity in trapped molecular ions, a cryogenic ion trap chamber has been constructed and characterized. At the center of the apparatus is a linear Paul ion trap, where Coulomb crystals can be formed for ion–neutral reaction studies. Optical access is provided, for lasers and for imaging of the crystals, alongside ion optics and a flight tube for recording time-of-flight mass spectra. The ion trap region, encased within two nested temperature stages, reaches temperatures below 9 K. To avoid vibrations from the cryocooler impeding laser cooling or imaging of the ions, vibration-damping elements are explicitly included. These components successfully inhibit the coupling of vibrations from the cold head to the ion trap—confirmed by accelerometer measurements and by the resolution of images recorded at the trap center (at 9 and 295 K). These results confirm that the cryogenic ion trap apparatus meets all requirements for studying ion–neutral reactions under cold, controlled conditions."
