We are developing a microwave ion trap capable of confining ultra-cold plasmas. If you cool a cloud of ions to temperatures as low as -273 degrees Celsius, it “freezes” and forms a “gas-phase” crystal. We aim to introduce an electron into this crystal and observe how it reacts with the ions. Once we make this electron stand still, we will watch how it switches between particle-like and wave-like behaviours. This may be exploited in quantum technologies that [we have no clue about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Lightning_(novel))

About the PI
======

Dr. Michal Hejduk's CV in a nutshell:

- 2013: PhD in cold plasma physics from [Prague](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html)
- 2014–2017: Postdoc in cluster physics at [Freiburg](https://www.physik.uni-freiburg.de/), Germany
- 2017–2020: [Post-doctoral research associate](http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/dr-michal-hejduk.aspx) in the [Heazlewood Group](http://heazlewood.chem.ox.ac.uk/) at the Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford (UK)
- 2020: Brief stint as an optical engineer in the automotive industry

Since 2021, Dr. Hejduk has been leading his own research in the field of sub-kelvin plasma. This involves the development of both planar and three-dimensional radio-frequency/microwave traps capable of confining electrons and ions simultaneously.
