excerpt: 'In this paper we describe measurements of electron-ion recombination coefficients for nuclear spin isomers of trihydrogen cations at temperatures down to 60 K. We confirmed that para nuclear spin isomers recombine with a significantly higher rate coefficient than ortho isomers. I developed a method how to modify a population of nuclear spin states of the ions in the existing flowing fterglow apparatus and interpreted the measured data.'
