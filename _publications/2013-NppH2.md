excerpt: "Using a cryogenic 22-pole trap, we studied a reaction of nuclear spin isomers of molecular hydrogen with atomic nitrogen ions. We observed something that could be interpreted as a dependence of the reaction rate coefficient on fine structure states of the ion. In order to prove a plausibility of this hypothesis, I constructed a computer model of chemical kinetics and compared the results with the experimental data. This has allowed us to extract state-specific rate coefficients for the reaction. It appears that each of the nitrogen ions fine structure states has a significantly different reactivity. This can influence interpretations of some of the emission spectra from interstellar clouds."
