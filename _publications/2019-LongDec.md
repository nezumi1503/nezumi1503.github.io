title: "Evolutionary algorithm optimisation of Zeeman deceleration: Is it worthwhile for longer decelerators?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-LongDec
excerpt: 'We have demonstrated that neutral radicals can be decelerated using relatively short Zeeman decelerators if the switching sequence for electromagnets is optimised using an evolutionary algorithm. It means that investments in long decelerators are not necessary in many cases. Now, several laboratories are considering adapting the same optimisation method to their own experiments. I supervised computer simulations performed by a master degree student and a PhD student.'
