This lecture provides an overview of atomic plasma physics and quantum control in the context of ultracold quantum systems. Topics covered include the history and fundamentals of laser cooling and trapping of atoms, techniques for cooling and controlling electrons, quantum dynamics of chemical reactions, properties of Rydberg atoms and ions, strongly coupled atomic plasma, and experimental studies of ultracold atomic ensembles. The course also addresses the challenges of trapping atoms and ions using various traps. The practical exercise focuses on the generation of cold ions using lasers. 

## Aim of course

The objective is to offer students a profound understanding of key concepts in the field of ultracold quantum systems and their potential applications.
