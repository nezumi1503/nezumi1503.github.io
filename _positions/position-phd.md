# Have you ever questioned
where the boundary between classical and quantum physics lies, or where the fine line between a molecule and a collection of particles is drawn? Are you curious about making plasma follow quantum (rather than classical) mechanical laws? Or does a vision of making a white dwarf star core on Earth attract you? If the answer is yes, you may be interested in studying for a PhD in the Ultra-cold Plasma Laboratory (UCPL) at the Department of Surface and Plasma Science of Charles University in Prague (Czechia). 

During the four-year study program, you will learn how to 

* design an ion trap, 
* construct a laser optics system, 
* manipulate quantum states of ions, 
* carry out computer simulations, 
* do spectroscopy measurements, 
* study elementary processes in plasmas via experiments. 

Those are certainly skills required for pursuing a scientific career, but you will find a use for them in the rapidly developing quantum technology industry as well! 

Why should you study in our group? Because of the project! It is so unique that Charles University has decided to financially support its initiation â€“ it is truly a high risk/high gain (that means exciting) endeavour. In our research we combine techniques commonly employed in quantum computing/simulation/sensing to plasma physics. The department offers a solid material background and a human network necessary for the successful completion of the degree within four years. The UCPL actively cooperates with a research group from the University of Liverpool, so you will become a member of an international network of scientists! 

And what will come next, after getting the PhD? Alumni of our departmental branch worked/are working at the universities in Freiburg, Cologne, Oxford and New York, and at institutes of the Max-Plack Society and the French National Centre for Scientific Research. 

Your success is our success, so come and do something new, come and build the quantum future in the heart of Europe, in the beautiful city of Prague! 

*The research group aims to increase the number of women in scientific positions. Female candidates are therefore encouraged to apply.*

 

### About Funding

The research project is funded from the PRIMUS Research Programme of Charles University that aims to support early career researchers coming from prestigious foreign research institutions.  

In addition to the standard monthly non-taxable scholarship, a doctoral student will receive a salary covering living costs and state health and social insurances. He/she will also have an opportunity to apply for internal research grants to develop skills necessary for living as a scientist.
