We study how to confine ultra-cold plasmas. If you cool a cloud of ions to temperatures as low as -273 degrees Celsius, it “freezes” and forms a “gas-phase” crystal. My goal is to introduce an electron into this crystal and observe how it reacts with the ions. Once we will manage to make this electron stand still and observe how it switches between particle-like and wave-like behaviours. This may be exploited in quantum technologies that [we have no clue about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Lightning_(novel)). 


About the PI
======

PI(MH)'s CV in a nutshell: 2013—PhD in cold plasma physics ([Prague](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html)), 2014—2017 cluster physics postdoc ([Freiburg](https://www.physik.uni-freiburg.de/), Germany), 2017—2020 [post-doctoral research associate](http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/dr-michal-hejduk.aspx) in the [Heazlewood Group](http://heazlewood.chem.ox.ac.uk/) at the Department of Chemistry of the University of Oxford (UK). In 2020, MH worked briefly as an optical engineer in the automotive industry.

From 2021, MH conducts his own research funded by [Charles University in Prague](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-558.html).
