I am a chemical physicist with research experience in fields of plasmochemistry, cluster physics and ultra-cold chemistry. Currently, I am constructing a device that confines a cloud of ions at such low temperatures (less than -273 degrees Celsius) that it “freezes” and forms a crystal. This will be eventually attached to a source of neutral atoms and molecules that move at a snail’s speed, typical for a gas cooled down to less than -260 degrees Celsius. By letting the ions and the neutrals collide in this way, we can study chemical reactions in their purest forms. In typical chemical experiments, one cannot identify the quantum states of reacting particles, making it impossible to determine which combination of states leads to a particular reaction outcome. However, in our experiments, neutral reactants are preselected according to their quantum state (which, very soon, we will also be able to do for ions as well). Gaining full control over chemical reactions is a long-term goal of this very new branch of chemistry called “ultracold chemistry”. Thanks to us, future chemists will be able to find new chemical pathways that reduce costs of production processes or lead to completely new chemicals.

In the future, I would like to establish an independent research program to learn more about Coulomb crystals, especially those containing electrons. So far, these crystals exist only in the cores of giant planets or white dwarfs. However, I would like to make them in a laboratory and study their potential to be used for quantum computing.

About me
======
I am a post-doctoral research associate in the [Heazlewood Group](http://heazlewood.chem.ox.ac.uk/) at the Departmenf of Chemistry of the University of Oxford (UK).

Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the [Institute of Physics](https://www.physik.uni-freiburg.de/) of the University of Freiburg (Germany). I gained my doctoral degree at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.mff.cuni.cz) of Charles University (Czech Republic).
